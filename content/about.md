I'm Joseph (Joey) Eremondi, a PhD student working with [Ron Garcia](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~rxg/) at the [UBC Software Practices Laboratory](https://spl.cs.ubc.ca/).

My research is centred around type systems for making code more reliable, and in the theory and practice of making such systems easier to use. In particular, I'm interested in mixing dependent types with gradual types and improving error messages for dependently-typed languages. I've also researched the properties of reversal-bounded counter automata.
