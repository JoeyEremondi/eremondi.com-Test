Iâ€™ve made a package that integrates the
[Ott Semantic Modelling tool](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/ott/) into Visual Studio Code.
Right now, it supports syntax highlighting, and showing error messages inline,
but I hope to eventually add support for source formatting, and prettifying symbols.

You can view the package [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JoeyEremondi.ott).

Pull requests, collaboration, suggestions are all welcome!
