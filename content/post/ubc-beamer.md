I recently had to make a LaTeX slideshow,
and was disappointed with how awful most of the themes looked.
I found the Metropolis theme, which was quite nice and modern, and I adapted it to have the UBC colours and logo.

You can see it live on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/zqngzmyspphw),
or you can see the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/JoeyEremondi/UBC-Metropolis-Beamer).

Suggestions or Pull requests are welcome!

If youâ€™re going to a conference, or even making a presentation in a class with lots of formulas, this could come in handy.
