So you [decided to do a PhD](http://jxyzabc.blogspot.com/2011/12/reasons-to-pursue-phd.html), [applied to a few schools](jxyzabc.blogspot.com/2012/10/faq-applying-to-graduate-school-for.html), and visited schools you got accepted to now. Now comes
the hard part of the process: deciding which school you're going to spend the
next 5+ years at. While I cannot provide a [checklist](https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/EmpiricalEvaluation/) or a simple answer, I can talk about my experience
when deciding on which school I should go to and a few questions that I answered
while making that decision.

> The title is *obviously* clickbait. However, in my case, it was not untrue.

### Why are you doing a PhD?

In my first interview during admission period, [Matthias Felleisen](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/~matthias/) asked me "Why do you want to do a PhD?" While simple,
superficial answers such as "I like learning new things", "I enjoy research", or
"I want *your* job" [^1] usually suffice in interview settings, they do not
help with profound life decisions.

For my decision, answers 1 and 3 pulled me in two different directions. Between
my choices, A, B, and C, I felt that going to school A might maximize my chances
of getting an academic job while going to B or C would maximize my ability to
learn new things.

In the end, answer 1 won out and choose to go to Cornell because I felt it
had [cool][adrian] [people][nate] who [enjoy][dexter] [programming][andru] [languages][greg] research.

### Are the grad students happy?

This was the primary reason I chose Cornell over other schools. All my choices
were good technical fits, but graduate students at Cornell seemed content with
what they were doing. Cornell's [free agent system](/post/free-agent-cornell)
initially turned me off because I was terrified of not finding an advisor.
However (as the above linked post mentions), this concern was ill founded and
I started working with my current advisor within a week of joining.

### On friends

My good friend [Sam Ginzburg](https://samginzburg.com/) helped me out a lot
with the decision process. Having a peer to talk to about graduate school
decisions can be incredibly helpful since they are not invested in recruiting
you to a particular school and might provide some objective insights about
your own thought processes.

The biggest argument that both my Mom and Sam made that help me make a decision
was, "the worst case is that you end up not enjoying and transfer to one of
your other choices"

### On coins

It is in fact true that I flipped a coin to make a decision about my graduate
school. However, it wasn't the coin flip that convinced me to go to a particular
school; it was the fact that I didn't want to flip the coin again.

### On decisions

Finally, I will end with this quote from my undergraduate advisor's [dissertation](https://repository.library.brown.edu/studio/item/bdr:297608/) [^2]:

> During a particularly trying time, Joe observed that “Some decisions in life are so important, like picking a career or a spouse, but you can’t iterate until you make the right decision, so you just have to do it,” and thus inspired me to press on.

Graduate school decisions might seem hard and the processes seem random. Perhaps,
a [leap of faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_of_faith#Kierkegaard,_Goethe,_Marx,_and_Tolstoy) is the only right choice we can make.
