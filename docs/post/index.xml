      <description>The way I often describe research to my non-research friends is by an uncessarily violent metaphor. I find research to be like head bashing a wall over and over till you find a way to break it and then repeating it ad nauseam. Sometimes you&amp;rsquo;ll know where the cracks in the wall are, and sometime you&amp;rsquo;ll know what angle you need to hit the wall with your head, but fundamentally, you&amp;rsquo;re hitting your head into a wall.</description>

Here is a short post about what the system is and why it worked for me.
How do grad schools work?</description>
