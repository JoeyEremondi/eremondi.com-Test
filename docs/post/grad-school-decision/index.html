<p>So you <a href="http://jxyzabc.blogspot.com/2011/12/reasons-to-pursue-phd.html" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">decided to do a PhD</a>, <a href="jxyzabc.blogspot.com/2012/10/faq-applying-to-graduate-school-for.html" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">applied to a few schools</a>, and visited schools you got accepted to now. Now comes
the hard part of the process: deciding which school you&rsquo;re going to spend the
next 5+ years at. While I cannot provide a <a href="https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/EmpiricalEvaluation/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">checklist</a> or a simple answer, I can talk about my experience
when deciding on which school I should go to and a few questions that I answered
while making that decision.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The title is <em>obviously</em> clickbait. However, in my case, it was not untrue.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="why-are-you-doing-a-phd">Why are you doing a PhD?</h3>

<p>In my first interview during admission period, <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/~matthias/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Matthias Felleisen</a> asked me &ldquo;Why do you want to do a PhD?&rdquo; While simple,
superficial answers such as &ldquo;I like learning new things&rdquo;, &ldquo;I enjoy research&rdquo;, or
&ldquo;I want <em>your</em> job&rdquo; <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> usually suffice in interview settings, they do not
help with profound life decisions.</p>

<p>For my decision, answers 1 and 3 pulled me in two different directions. Between
my choices, A, B, and C, I felt that going to school A might maximize my chances
of getting an academic job while going to B or C would maximize my ability to
learn new things.</p>

<p>In the end, answer 1 won out and choose to go to Cornell because I felt it
had <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">cool</a> <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jnfoster/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">people</a> who <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~kozen/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">enjoy</a> <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/andru/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">programming</a> <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jgm/jgm.html" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">languages</a> research.</p>

<h3 id="are-the-grad-students-happy">Are the grad students happy?</h3>

<p>This was the primary reason I chose Cornell over other schools. All my choices
were good technical fits, but graduate students at Cornell seemed content with
what they were doing. Cornell&rsquo;s <a href="../../post/free-agent-cornell">free agent system</a>
initially turned me off because I was terrified of not finding an advisor.
However (as the above linked post mentions), this concern was ill founded and
I started working with my current advisor within a week of joining.</p>

<h3 id="on-friends">On friends</h3>

<p>My good friend <a href="https://samginzburg.com/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Sam Ginzburg</a> helped me out a lot
with the decision process. Having a peer to talk to about graduate school
decisions can be incredibly helpful since they are not invested in recruiting
you to a particular school and might provide some objective insights about
your own thought processes.</p>

<p>The biggest argument that both my Mom and Sam made that help me make a decision
was, &ldquo;the worst case is that you end up not enjoying and transfer to one of
your other choices&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="on-coins">On coins</h3>

<p>It is in fact true that I flipped a coin to make a decision about my graduate
school. However, it wasn&rsquo;t the coin flip that convinced me to go to a particular
school; it was the fact that I didn&rsquo;t want to flip the coin again.</p>

<h3 id="on-decisions">On decisions</h3>

<p>Finally, I will end with this quote from my undergraduate advisor&rsquo;s <a href="https://repository.library.brown.edu/studio/item/bdr:297608/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">dissertation</a> <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>During a particularly trying time, Joe observed that “Some decisions in life are so important, like picking a career or a spouse, but you can’t iterate until you make the right decision, so you just have to do it,” and thus inspired me to press on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Graduate school decisions might seem hard and the processes seem random. Perhaps,
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_of_faith#Kierkegaard,_Goethe,_Marx,_and_Tolstoy" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">leap of faith</a> is the only right choice we can make.</p>
