      <description>During a recent PLDG talk, the speaker said, &amp;ldquo;I think that, as a community, PL people have a moral responsibility to step in and say, No, you&amp;rsquo;re having fun wrong!&amp;rdquo; While I have no qualms about the comment itself (researchers should be able to not take themselves seriously sometimes), it led me to think about the way PL research is applied in new domains. The speaker usually starts with an overview of the domain and talks about the current state of the art of programming languages and tools in it.</description>

      <description>Stopify began began when Arjun asked me the question &amp;ldquo;What would it take to build a stop button for browser based IDEs?&amp;rdquo; (paraphrased) towards the 2016. The general idea behind building this was to implement [first class continuations] for JavaScript that would allow us to control JavaScript pages running on web pages. We started by looking into a [2005 paper by Pettyjohn et al.] on implementing continuations on target machines that have no provisions for accessing the run-time stack.</description>
